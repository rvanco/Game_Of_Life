# Game_of_Life (Julia implementation)

little project in julia

## Orginal Code :

* In the folder "_Conwayâ€™s Game Of Life_" there is a code that recreate the original rules invented by Conway.
* Rules are explained there.

## Personal modification :

In the folder "_Personnal modification_" (which is still in progress) there is a code that I created because I wanted to go a little further and see what I can add to the "game" to make it closer to the "life" we know.
