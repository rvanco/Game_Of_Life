# Personnal Modification

## Done :

* Create a map with a difference between ocean and land


## In work :
* Different species (little herbivore, big herbivore, little carnivore, big carnivore, grass, trees .... ????)


## To do :

* create a possible evolution (create the concept of anger, if the little are not angry since long ago they go to big and the inverse can be done)

## Finality :

* Recreate an ecosystem as complex as possible and resolved it as precisely as possible


## Crazy idea :
### different climate/Biome 

### evloving map :
* Allow passage (and evolution) between land and ocean ?
* moving continent ?
